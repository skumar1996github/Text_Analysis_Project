I bought an old mirror at a flea market. It was ornate, beautiful—and oddly cheap. That night, I noticed my reflection blinking when I didn’t. I froze. Then it smiled. I didn’t.  
I covered the mirror, but in the morning, the cloth was gone. The reflection still smiled.  
I smashed it. Glass scattered, but the reflection stood intact, now free, stepping through the frame.  
Now I’m trapped on the other side, screaming silently, watching as it walks away in my skin.  
If you ever see your reflection move on its own—run.  
<eos>

<sos>  
Every night at 2:59 a.m., I hear a knock at the door. I never open it.  
Last night, I looked through the peephole. A copy of me stood there, smiling.  
Tonight, I left the lights off and peeked again.  
No one.  
Then a whisper from behind: “You missed me.”  
I turned.  
Nothing.  
But the door creaked open.  
And now I’m staring at myself, grinning wider than a human face should allow.  
I don’t think I’ll be here tomorrow.  
If you hear knocking past midnight—don’t answer.  
It doesn’t want to come in. It wants you to leave.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My daughter told me she has a new friend in the closet.  
Cute, I thought—until she said he only comes out when I’m asleep.  
I laughed it off.  
Then I found tiny handprints on the inside of the door.  
We don’t have pets.  
Last night, I pretended to sleep.  
At 3 a.m., the closet creaked open. Something crawled out, hunched and shadowy.  
It whispered to my daughter: “He’s still awake.”  
Now, I sleep with a knife.  
But I don’t know if it’ll help.  
The handprints are bigger this morning.  
<eos>

<sos>  
They say if you stare into a dark mirror and whisper your name backwards, something answers.  
I tried it. Nothing happened.  
Until I went to bed and saw someone standing in the hallway mirror.  
It wasn’t me.  
It waved.  
I turned the mirror around, but the reflection stayed—on the wall.  
Now it copies everything in reverse.  
Last night, I watched it crawl out of the mirror, mouth open unnaturally wide.  
It whispered my name—correctly.  
Tonight, I’ll sleep with the lights on.  
But I don’t think it matters anymore.  
It already knows where I live.  
<eos>

<sos>  
We found an old tape recorder in the attic.  
It had one message: “Don’t listen.”  
Of course, we pressed play. Static, then a child’s voice: “Help me.”  
We played it again. Now it said: “It’s coming.”  
We stopped.  
That night, something knocked from inside the attic.  
The next morning, the recorder played itself: “Too late.”  
We burned it.  
The ashes whispered.  
Now, every night, we hear footsteps above the ceiling—closer each time.  
I don’t think it was ever a child.  
I don’t think it wanted help.  
It just needed someone to listen.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I found a journal in the woods. The last entry read: “It’s watching me write this.”  
The next page was blank—until I turned it over. My name was written in red.  
I dropped the journal.  
But now every night, I dream of the woods.  
Last night, I woke with mud on my feet.  
Tonight, the journal is on my pillow again.  
And the new entry reads: “He’s coming for you next.”  
I never told anyone my name.  
Whatever wrote this knows me.  
And I think it’s waiting just outside.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My neighbor died last week. I saw the body taken away.  
But last night, I saw him through the window, watering his plants.  
I knocked. He waved.  
His skin looked gray.  
I called the police—they found nothing.  
Now he knocks on my door at midnight.  
Politely.  
I don’t answer.  
But this morning, my plants were watered.  
And a note on the door read: “Your turn.”  
Tonight, I’m staying awake.  
But I can already smell the soil.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I bought a second-hand phone.  
It only had one contact: “Mom.”  
Curious, I texted “Hi.”  
She replied instantly: “Where are you? It’s dark.”  
I asked who she was.  
She sent a photo.  
It was me—as a child—crying in a forest.  
I’ve never been to a forest.  
She texted again: “He’s here.”  
Then a voice note.  
I pressed play.  
My own voice whispered, “Don’t answer the door.”  
Then came a knock.  
<eos>

<sos>  
They say the house at the end of the lane is abandoned.  
Every window boarded, the lawn overgrown.  
But I saw candlelight last night.  
Curious, I stepped inside.  
The air was cold.  
In the center of the room, a mirror.  
I looked in.  
My reflection blinked.  
I didn’t.  
I turned to run, but I was already gone.  
Now I watch from inside the mirror as people enter.  
I hope someone looks in soon.  
I’m tired of waiting.  
<eos>

<sos>  
Every night, I hear a lullaby through the baby monitor.  
We don’t have a baby.  
I unplugged it. Still, the lullaby plays.  
One night, I followed the sound to the nursery—empty, dust-covered.  
The cradle rocked gently.  
There was something inside.  
Not a baby.  
Just teeth.  
Now, every night, I hear crying.  
Not from the monitor—inside the walls.  
Whatever’s singing isn’t comforting a child.  
It’s calling for me.  
<eos>
<sos>  
I rented a cabin in the woods to escape city life. The first night, I heard footsteps on the roof—then scratches at the door.  
I checked: nothing.  
The second night, the whispers started. Faint at first, then louder: “Let us in.”  
I nailed the windows shut.  
Last night, I woke to find muddy footprints across the floor—leading to my bed.  
I sleep with a knife now.  
Tonight, the door is wide open.  
But the worst part?  
I locked it from the inside.  
<eos>

<sos>  
Every morning, my mirror fogs up, and words appear: “MISS ME?”  
I thought it was a prank.  
Until I moved.  
Different mirror, same message.  
I smashed it.  
The next day, the bathroom tiles spelled it out in condensation.  
“MISS ME?”  
I never wrote that.  
No one has my keys.  
I once had a twin.  
She died in that bathroom, years ago.  
Now she wants me to remember.  
And to join her.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I found an old Polaroid camera at a thrift store.  
Every photo I take shows someone standing behind me.  
Always the same figure—pale, grinning, eyes black.  
I live alone.  
I smashed the camera. Burned the photos.  
The next morning, there was a new photo taped to my fridge.  
Me, asleep.  
The figure was closer this time.  
Tonight, I’ll sleep with the lights on.  
But I know it won’t matter.  
Because I just heard the click of a shutter.  
And I don’t own a camera anymore.  
<eos>

<sos>  
There’s a man who watches me from the bus stop every night.  
He never moves. Never blinks.  
Just stares.  
One night, I waved.  
He grinned.  
That night, he was at the end of my driveway.  
The next, on my porch.  
Tonight, he’s inside, standing at the foot of my bed.  
I still haven’t seen him move.  
But every night, he’s closer.  
And now, I can’t move either.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My dog barks at the basement every night.  
We thought it was rats.  
Until he refused to go near the stairs.  
Last night, I went down with a flashlight.  
Found claw marks on the walls—six feet off the ground.  
Something growled in the corner.  
I ran.  
Now, every morning, the basement door is open.  
We keep it locked.  
I don’t think it’s rats anymore.  
And I don’t think it wants the dog.  
<eos>

<sos>  
The doll appeared on my doorstep wrapped in a stained cloth.  
No note. Just buttons for eyes and stitches for a mouth.  
I threw it out.  
The next day, it was on my bed.  
I burned it.  
At 3:00 a.m., I woke to the smell of smoke—and found the doll in my hands, untouched.  
Now its mouth is unstitched.  
And at night, I hear it whispering from the closet.  
It knows my name.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My phone keeps getting voicemails from my own number.  
When I play them, it’s static—then screaming.  
One message ended with: “Don’t go outside.”  
I laughed.  
Then came the pounding on the door.  
No one was there.  
I checked the voicemail again.  
It had changed: “Too late.”  
Now the door won’t open.  
And I can hear myself screaming—outside.  
<eos>

<sos>  
They warned me not to whistle at night.  
Said it invites the forest spirits.  
I didn’t believe them.  
So I whistled.  
Now, every night, I hear whistling back—mimicking my tune, but off-key.  
Last night, it was under my window.  
Tonight, it’s inside the house.  
It’s not trying to copy me.  
It’s trying to lure me into the woods.  
And I think I’m starting to forget why that’s bad.  
<eos>

<sos>  
We moved into a house with a locked room.  
No key, no way in.  
One night, the door creaked open on its own.  
Inside, a child's room—untouched, dusty.  
A music box played by itself.  
My daughter said, “She’s back.”  
We don’t have a daughter.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I was driving home when I saw a hitchhiker in the rain.  
I stopped. No one was there.  
Minutes later, I saw her again—closer.  
Every mile, she appeared again, dripping, staring.  
When I got home, the backseat was wet.  
And her handprint was on the window—inside.  
<eos>
<sos>  
I found a voicemail from myself dated tomorrow.  
My voice whispered, “Don’t answer the door at 9:17.”  
At 9:17, there was a knock.  
I stared at the door, heart racing.  
Another voicemail came in—again, from me.  
Screaming.  
The door burst open.  
No one was there.  
Just silence.  
Now it’s 9:18, and everything feels wrong.  
The lights flicker, my reflection is gone, and the phone won’t stop ringing.  
I don’t think I was warning myself.  
I think I was too late.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My baby monitor crackled to life at midnight.  
Soft lullabies played, though my daughter was asleep beside me.  
I checked the nursery.  
Empty.  
Then the monitor whispered, “She’s not your daughter.”  
I looked at the sleeping child.  
She opened her eyes—solid black.  
She smiled.  
“I like this one better.”  
Now she calls me Mommy, but I don’t sleep anymore.  
I keep waiting for her to blink.  
She never does.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I woke up with a strange tattoo on my arm.  
A spiral of symbols I didn’t recognize.  
The next day, another one appeared—on my back.  
Each night, more marks.  
I visited a priest.  
He fainted when he saw them.  
He whispered, “It’s a summoning.”  
Now the marks glow in the dark.  
And I hear chanting in the walls.  
Something is coming.  
And it’s wearing my skin.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My husband died last year.  
But every night, I feel him lie beside me.  
Same weight on the mattress, same warmth.  
I never opened my eyes.  
Until last night.  
It wasn’t him.  
It had no face, just a stretched mouth full of teeth.  
It whispered, “He said you’d be warm.”  
Now I sleep on the floor.  
But it still joins me.  
And it's learning how to speak like him.  
<eos>

<sos>  
There’s a painting in the hallway we didn’t buy.  
A dark forest, with a small figure in the distance.  
Each morning, the figure is closer.  
I tried removing the painting, but it always reappears.  
Last night, the figure reached the edge of the canvas.  
This morning, the hallway is colder.  
And there are muddy footprints on the floor.  
Tonight, I think it will step out.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I adopted a stray cat.  
She never blinked.  
One night, she stood on two legs and whispered, “Thank you.”  
I laughed, assuming I imagined it.  
The next morning, my dog was gone.  
The cat grew larger.  
Now she watches me sleep, mouth curled into a human smile.  
I think she’s waiting for something.  
I think I’m next.  
<eos>

<sos>  
They told me the forest was cursed.  
Voices lure you in, they said.  
I laughed—until I heard my mother’s voice calling from the trees.  
She died ten years ago.  
Still, I followed.  
The forest grew darker, the voice closer.  
Then silence.  
I turned back.  
I was alone.  
Now I hear my own voice calling others in.  
And I can’t stop walking.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I got a new phone number.  
Strange texts arrived: “Where did you go?”  
“I miss your face.”  
Then photos—of me sleeping.  
I changed numbers again.  
A text arrived: “You can’t leave. We’re inside now.”  
The screen cracked.  
A distorted face smiled through the static.  
Now, even with the phone off, it whispers.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My therapist told me to keep a dream journal.  
I wrote about the man with no eyes who watches me sleep.  
The next day, the journal had new entries—written in someone else’s handwriting.  
“Don’t trust her,” they said.  
Now I see him in the corner of my room.  
And my therapist just cancelled our sessions.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My grandmother’s music box plays when no one touches it.  
It only plays one melody—one she played before she died.  
Last night, it played backwards.  
When I checked, it was open, and a strand of gray hair lay inside.  
She was buried without her hair.  
This morning, her bedroom door was open.  
She was waiting inside.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I received a letter addressed to my dead brother.  
It read, “You owe us one soul.”  
I burned it.  
The next day, I found another on my pillow: “Burning doesn’t count.”  
Now my reflection smiles without me.  
And the shadows whisper his name.  
They say I have until midnight.  
<eos>

<sos>  
The elevator skipped my floor again.  
When it stopped, the doors opened to a hallway I didn’t recognize.  
Red lights. Wet walls.  
I stepped out.  
The doors closed behind me.  
No buttons.  
No way back.  
Now something follows me here.  
And every door leads to the same hallway.  
I think I left my world behind.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I hear tapping on my window every night.  
I live on the 14th floor.  
One night, I looked.  
A face smiled back—mouth too wide, eyes too small.  
It mouthed, “Let me in.”  
I closed the blinds.  
Now the tapping comes from the inside.  
<eos>

<sos>  
They said the lake was bottomless.  
As kids, we joked about monsters.  
One day, my brother vanished while swimming.  
Ten years later, I saw him again—wet, pale, unchanged.  
He said, “It’s warm down there.”  
He grabbed my arm.  
Now I hear voices from the drain.  
They want me to come home.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I woke up to find everyone in the town gone.  
Cars still running. Meals half-eaten.  
I searched all day.  
No one.  
That night, the TVs turned on.  
Every channel showed me—sleeping.  
Now, I’m afraid to close my eyes.  
Because I think that’s when they watch.  
<eos>

<sos>  
The antique store owner warned me not to wind the clock.  
I did anyway.  
Time stopped.  
Birds froze mid-flight. The air stilled.  
But something moved—tall, robed, faceless.  
It walked only while the world stood still.  
Now I never touch the clock.  
But sometimes, it ticks on its own.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My dreams feel too real lately.  
Last night, I dreamt I lost a finger.  
I woke up bleeding.  
Today, I dreamt I was buried alive.  
Now I can’t move, and dirt fills my mouth.  
I don’t think I’m dreaming anymore.  
<eos>

<sos>  
A child’s laughter echoes through my apartment every night.  
I don’t have kids.  
I followed the sound to the vents.  
Tiny handprints cover the inside.  
I blocked them.  
Now the laughter comes from my closet.  
And it’s getting louder.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My shadow doesn’t follow me anymore.  
It walks beside me.  
Sometimes, it lingers behind.  
Once, I caught it watching me sleep.  
Now it mimics movements I haven’t made.  
I tried locking the lights off.  
It still moved.  
I think it’s tired of being in the dark.  
<eos>

<sos>  
The cemetery gate was open at midnight.  
A note hung on it: “Welcome home.”  
I walked in, curious.  
Every gravestone bore my name—different dates.  
One said today.  
Now I can’t find the exit.  
And I hear digging behind me.  
<eos>
<sos>  
I woke up with a second heartbeat in my chest.  
It thumped out of sync with mine.  
Doctors found nothing.  
But at night, it sped up—especially when I was alone.  
Then came the whispers.  
“Let me out.”  
One morning, I found claw marks across my ribs.  
Now I wear chains when I sleep.  
Last night, they were broken.  
And I only hear one heartbeat now.  
It’s not mine.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My TV turned on by itself.  
Static filled the screen.  
A voice hissed, “Stay awake.”  
I unplugged it.  
Still, it glowed.  
Then it showed my living room—live—except there was someone standing behind me.  
I turned around.  
Empty.  
The TV whispered again: “Don’t blink.”  
I blinked.  
Now the room on screen is empty… and so is mine.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I bought a haunted house as a joke.  
Ghost tours, creaky floors—classic stuff.  
Then one night, I heard sobbing in the walls.  
I found a sealed door behind the bookshelf.  
Inside: a room with chains and claw marks.  
A girl’s voice whispered, “You opened it.”  
Now the chains drag across the floor at night.  
And she’s getting closer.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My phone camera shows things I can’t see with my eyes.  
Shadows behind people, faces in windows.  
One photo showed someone sleeping in my bed.  
I live alone.  
Last night, I took a selfie.  
The reflection was smiling wider than I was.  
Now it’s not just in the camera.  
It’s in the mirror, waving.  
<eos>

<sos>  
The vent in my room started whispering my name.  
Softly at first.  
Then louder.  
I tried to block it.  
It laughed.  
One night, I peeked inside.  
Two eyes stared back.  
It said, “You look like a nice skin.”  
Now I hear crawling in the walls.  
And my reflection’s begun to peel.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I dug up an old grave on a dare.  
Found a mirror instead of a coffin.  
My reflection winked.  
Now it follows me, but only when no one’s watching.  
I catch glimpses in car windows and puddles.  
It’s not copying me anymore.  
It’s practicing how to move on its own.  
<eos>

<sos>  
A knock at 3:33 a.m. every night.  
Always three knocks.  
Always silence after.  
One night, I knocked back.  
The knocks doubled.  
Then a voice whispered, “I’m coming in.”  
The door stayed closed—but the windows didn’t.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My sister died young.  
We buried her favorite doll with her.  
Years later, I found the same doll on my bed.  
It blinked.  
“I missed you,” it said.  
Now I hear her voice through it.  
And she’s angry I let her die.  
<eos>

<sos>  
We bought a used couch.  
Cheap. Comfortable.  
That night, I felt something shift inside.  
We cut it open.  
Found fingernails. Teeth.  
And a note: “Still hungry.”  
Now I hear chewing beneath the cushions.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I found a dusty diary in the attic.  
Every entry was dated tomorrow.  
They described everything I’d do—exactly.  
One entry ended with, “Then he screamed.”  
I stopped reading.  
But the diary updates itself every night.  
And the screams are getting louder.  
<eos>

<sos>  
In the snow, I saw bare footprints leading away from my house.  
None led back.  
I followed them into the woods.  
They stopped at a tree.  
Above, something watched.  
It looked like me.  
Now it's wearing my clothes.  
And no one notices I’m gone.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My dreams show me people I’ve never met.  
They always die horribly.  
Then, weeks later, I see them on the news.  
Last night, I dreamt of my best friend.  
I called him.  
He answered, “Too late.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
There’s a second moon in the sky.  
Only I can see it.  
It’s getting bigger.  
At night, I hear it hum.  
Others say I’m hallucinating.  
But last night, it opened an eye.  
And now I’m not sure I’m from here.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My closet door creaks open every night at 2:06.  
Never 2:05. Never 2:07.  
I nailed it shut.  
It still opened.  
Now I sleep elsewhere.  
But the door always finds me.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My voice echoes back too quickly now.  
And it says different things.  
I said, “Hello.”  
It replied, “Don’t trust him.”  
I live alone.  
<eos>

<sos>  
The painting in the hallway always shows a storm.  
But the weather outside is sunny.  
One night, lightning struck in the painting—and I smelled smoke.  
The next morning, the hallway wall was scorched.  
Now the storm's over.  
But there’s a shadow standing in the frame.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My roommate talks in his sleep.  
Last night, he whispered coordinates.  
I checked them—an abandoned farmhouse.  
Inside, shallow graves.  
One had my name on it.  
He smiled when I confronted him.  
“You weren’t supposed to look yet.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
At midnight, my GPS reroutes me down a dirt road.  
No signal.  
No lights.  
Then it says, “You’ve arrived.”  
I’m in the middle of nowhere.  
Something knocks on the window.  
<eos>

<sos>  
Every mirror in the house shattered at once.  
Except one.  
That one now shows a different room.  
I tried covering it.  
The cloth burned away.  
I see myself inside that other room—trapped, screaming.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I get voicemails of myself crying.  
I don’t remember recording them.  
One said, “Don’t go to the basement.”  
I checked.  
Now I don’t get voicemails anymore.  
Because I’m still down here.  
<eos>

<sos>  
The doorbell rings every night at 4:04 a.m.  
No one’s ever there.  
Until last night.  
A man in black stood silently.  
He whispered, “Not yet.”  
Now I dread the night he says, “Now.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
My neighbor mows his lawn at night.  
Without a mower.  
Just pushing air.  
I asked him why.  
He said, “Keeps them asleep.”  
Last night, he didn’t mow.  
And I heard digging under my floorboards.  
<eos>

<sos>  
There’s a door in the hospital that no one remembers.  
Room 616.  
I opened it once.  
Inside were versions of me—dead, twisted.  
Now I dream of that room.  
And I’m afraid one of them got out.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My dreams end the same way.  
A knock. A scream. A face I don’t recognize.  
Then I wake up bleeding.  
Doctors can’t explain it.  
But the face is starting to look like mine.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I was alone in the elevator when the floor number changed to “-1.”  
The doors opened into darkness.  
A voice said, “Home.”  
I pressed every button.  
None responded.  
The doors are still open.  
Something is waiting.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I downloaded a meditation app.  
Its voice was soothing.  
Until it said, “Let your soul drift from your body.”  
Then I couldn’t move.  
I watched myself stand, smile, and walk away.  
<eos>

<sos>  
There’s a new tenant upstairs.  
But this building only has one floor.  
I hear footsteps, dragging sounds.  
I told the landlord.  
He paled.  
“That apartment burned down in ’92.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
My reflection blinked after I left the mirror.  
Then it stepped out.  
Now I’m trapped on the other side.  
It’s living my life.  
And no one knows.  
<eos>

<sos>  
Each night, I wake up one minute later.  
1:01, 1:02, 1:03…  
Now it's 3:59.  
At 4:00, something knocks.  
I don’t know what happens if I answer.  
But I think I always do.  
<eos>

The scarecrow in the field moved today.  
No wind. No animals.  
Its head turned to follow me.  
I ran.  
Tonight, it’s outside my window.  
Still smiling.  
<eos>

My daughter came home from school with a drawing.  
It was our family—but with an extra figure.  
When I asked who it was, she said, “That’s the lady who watches me sleep.”  
I laughed it off.  
Until I saw the same figure in the background of our family photos, standing closer each time.  
Now she’s no longer in the photos.  
She’s in our hallway.  
<eos>

<sos>  
There’s a door in our basement we never opened.  
Last week, it appeared slightly ajar.  
Inside was a staircase descending into darkness.  
We never had a second basement.  
My brother went down.  
He didn’t scream.  
But now at night, I hear someone else coming up the stairs.  
It knocks, waiting to be let in.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My new apartment came with a grandfather clock.  
It chimes at 2:59 a.m. every night, not 3:00.  
Then I hear footsteps behind me.  
I tried moving the clock—impossible.  
I smashed it.  
Now the chimes come from inside the walls.  
And I think they’re counting down.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I got a letter from myself.  
Postmarked next week.  
It read, “Don’t look at the moon.”  
Confused, I glanced outside.  
The moon was massive, pulsing.  
Beautiful.  
Now it whispers my name at night.  
And I don’t think I’m me anymore.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I bought an old camera at a yard sale.  
Every photo I take shows people with no eyes.  
Even if they had eyes before.  
I took a selfie.  
Now mirrors show me eyeless, too.  
And I can’t see my reflection anymore.  
<eos>

<sos>  
There’s something living under my bed.  
I hear it breathe.  
It mimics my voice at night, crying for help.  
I made the mistake of answering.  
It grabbed my ankle.  
Now I walk with a limp.  
And it’s learning to speak better.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My clock stopped at 3:15 a.m.  
Every night.  
Even after replacing it.  
I set up a camera.  
At 3:15, the screen went black.  
Then static.  
Then me, sleeping—while something crawled from under the bed.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I moved into a high-rise apartment.  
On the 13th floor.  
Except the elevator skips from 12 to 14.  
At night, I hear a ding…  
But the button for 13 is never lit.  
Last night, it lit up by itself.  
The doors opened.  
And I heard my name.  
<eos>

<sos>  
There’s a mannequin in the attic.  
We didn’t put it there.  
It faces the corner.  
Every day it moves slightly—head tilted, arm raised.  
Yesterday, it pointed at me.  
Today, it’s standing by the stairs.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My dreams show me a field of crosses.  
Each one with my name.  
Every night, one cross disappears.  
I’ve counted twenty-nine.  
Tonight, there are none left.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My wife hums a lullaby in her sleep.  
Problem is, she died two weeks ago.  
I buried her myself.  
Last night, I woke to find her lying beside me.  
Still humming.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I thought my reflection was slow to follow.  
Then it started doing things I didn’t.  
Blinking when I didn’t blink.  
Smiling when I frowned.  
Now it doesn’t appear in mirrors.  
Only when the lights are off.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I got a text that just said, “Behind you.”  
I laughed.  
Then came another: “Don’t laugh.”  
I turned.  
Nothing.  
Then my phone camera opened on its own.  
And showed someone standing behind me.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My dog growls at the corner of the room.  
Always the same spot.  
We moved apartments.  
He still growls.  
Last night, he whimpered and backed away.  
I looked.  
Something growled back.  
<eos>

<sos>  
They said my twin died at birth.  
But I hear someone crying in the mirror.  
She says she was forgotten.  
She wants to trade places.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My son has an imaginary friend.  
He says she lives in the walls.  
She tells him secrets.  
He drew her for me.  
She looks like me—but with her eyes missing.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I found a key in the garden.  
It didn’t fit any lock in the house.  
Until I found a small trapdoor under the floorboards.  
It opened to a tunnel lined with mirrors.  
Each one showed me older, weaker.  
At the end: a version of me, smiling.  
And waiting.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I hear knocking from inside my closet.  
But only when it’s open.  
If I close it, the knocking stops.  
But last night, it knocked twice.  
Then opened on its own.  
<eos>

<sos>  
There’s a child’s voice on the baby monitor.  
But I don’t have a child.  
It giggles, sings, asks to play.  
Last night, it said, “I’m in your room.”  
And the monitor cut to black.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I woke up to find all the mirrors turned around.  
When I fixed them, none of them showed my reflection.  
But something else moved in them.  
It looked like me.  
Only hungrier.  
<eos>

<sos>  
We painted over strange symbols in the basement.  
Now the paint peels itself every night.  
And the symbols glow faint red.  
Last night, one of them moved.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I bought a music box at an estate sale.  
It plays a lullaby I’ve never heard—but know by heart.  
When it plays, I lose track of time.  
Last time, I blinked and six hours had passed.  
Now I hear the tune when the box is closed.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My wife started talking in a different voice.  
She doesn’t remember it.  
But the voice knows things she doesn’t.  
It told me when I’d die.  
I haven’t told her yet.  
Because she’s not my wife anymore.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I found a message carved into the ceiling above my bed: “They watch when you sleep.”  
I live alone.  
And my ceiling is ten feet high.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My fingers started going numb.  
Then cold.  
I woke up to find soil under my nails.  
And a tombstone outside with today’s date.  
<eos>

<sos>  
There’s a melody only I can hear.  
It’s beautiful.  
Addictive.  
I hum it constantly.  
Last night, someone knocked and whispered the next verse.  
<eos>

<sos>  
I saw a live stream of my bedroom online.  
I don’t have a camera.  
In the chat, someone wrote: “He’s waking up.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
Every time I sneeze, I see a glimpse of another world.  
Burning skies. Screaming faces.  
Last time, something saw me back.  
<eos>

<sos>  
My voice assistant answered a question I didn’t ask.  
Its voice changed.  
It said, “He’s listening through me.”

It was abandoned, decaying.

Every holiday, she mailed herself a card to feel less alone. One year, a second envelope arrived: “Next year, let me write it.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
He left his number on a dollar bill as a joke. She found it in change and called. “Wasn’t expecting anyone to try,” he laughed. “I’m not just anyone,” she said.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She asked him to hold her place in line. He waited half an hour. When she returned, she said, “Anyone who waits that long deserves dinner.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
He always left bookstore receipts inside novels. She found one with a scribbled quote: “Love is on page 89.” She turned there and saw a phone number.  
<eos>

<sos>  
They met during a blackout, voices only in the dark. The lights returned, and they smiled. “You sounded like someone I’d love,” she said. “You look like someone I already do.”  
<eos>
<sos>  
She always sat on the same bench by the lake, sketching strangers. One day, he approached, holding one of her lost drawings. “You drew me,” he said. “And I kept coming back, hoping you’d draw us.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
They bumped into each other in the rain, her umbrella flipping inside out. He offered to share his. She laughed, drenched. “Guess we’re stuck together,” he said. “Best storm I’ve been in,” she replied.  
<eos>

<sos>  
Every morning, he ordered two coffees and left one behind. She always arrived minutes later and drank it. One day, a note was under the cup: “Shall we skip the routine and meet properly?”  
<eos>

<sos>  
He moved into the apartment next door. She heard him playing piano at night—soft, hesitant notes. One evening, she slipped a note under his door: “Play that again. I was listening.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
She lost her scarf at the bookstore. He found it tucked between pages of her favorite author. When she returned to ask, he handed it over, smiling. “I was hoping you'd come back.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
They met at a flea market, both reaching for the same vintage camera. He let go first. “Trade you for your number?” he said. She handed him a photo instead—with her number on the back.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He saw her dancing in the park, alone, earbuds in. Without thinking, he joined. She laughed, took one out, and said, “You’re either crazy or perfect.” “Maybe both,” he grinned.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She posted anonymous poetry on lampposts. He replied with his own verses. One morning, a poem ended with: “Let’s meet where words began.” She was there, pen in hand.  
<eos>

<sos>  
Their hands touched reaching for the last box of cereal. “You take it,” she said. “Only if you have breakfast with me,” he replied.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He brought his dog to the same park every Sunday. She brought hers too. The dogs became fast friends. One day, she asked, “Think they’re trying to tell us something?”  
<eos>

<sos>  
She returned to the beach where she scattered her love letters to the sea. One drifted back, sealed in a bottle. Inside: “I’ve been writing you too.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
He complimented her handwriting on a receipt. She smiled, handed him a napkin: “Write something back.” He returned it with a coffee date and a phone number.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She whispered her wish into a fountain. He did the same. They both stayed a moment too long. “Wish for love?” he asked. “Yes,” she smiled. “Me too,” he said.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He saw her every week at the grocery store, always in the fruit aisle. One day, she turned and said, “You follow bananas like it’s fate.” He replied, “Maybe I’m following you.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
She ran a book club for one—until he showed up. “Accidentally overheard,” he said. She laughed, “You’re welcome to stay.” He never missed a chapter again.  
<eos>

<sos>  
They met at an art class. She painted chaos. He painted silence. Together, their canvases began to mirror something in between—something they both needed.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He played guitar in the subway. She always listened, never spoke. One day, he stopped mid-song and asked, “Will you dance?” She did—and stayed until the last note.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She fixed watches; he broke them—on purpose. “It’s just an excuse to see you,” he confessed. She smiled. “Good thing I like repairing time.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
He left his umbrella at her café table. She ran after him but kept it when she saw he left his name and number tucked inside.  
<eos>

<sos>  
They kept meeting in line at the coffee shop, always one person apart. One day, he paid for her drink and left his phone number on the sleeve.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She hosted trivia nights at the pub. He never won, but never missed a Monday. “You’re terrible at this,” she teased. “I come for the host,” he said.  
<eos>

<sos>  
They wrote their names in the fogged-up train window each morning—never speaking, only smiling. One day, he wrote “Coffee?” instead. She nodded.  
<eos>

<sos>  
Her plane was delayed; he offered her his charger. They talked for hours, ignoring the announcement. When it came time to board, she said, “Next flight together?”  
<eos>

<sos>  
They met on a volunteer cleanup crew, both covered in mud and laughing. “Not exactly romantic,” he joked. She wiped dirt from his cheek. “Could be.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
She taught yoga. He fell over in his first class. “You’re brave to come back,” she said the next week. “You’re the reason I did,” he admitted.  
<eos>

<sos>  
At a costume party, she was an astronaut; he was a star. “Perfect match,” she said. “I was waiting for you to orbit,” he replied.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He always left sticky notes in library books. She found one that read, “Hope you find what you’re looking for.” She added her number and a smiley face.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She left a scarf in his cab. He drove back across town to return it. “Most wouldn’t bother,” she said. “Most don’t believe in fate,” he replied.  
<eos>

<sos>  
Their online game usernames matched accidentally. They started chatting. Weeks later, they met in person, both wearing matching T-shirts: “Player 2 has entered the game.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
She forgot her wallet at the bakery. He paid. She returned the next day with a note: “Thanks for the croissant—and the chance to see you again.”  
<eos>
<sos>  
He always chose the same seat at the café, across from the window. One day, she sat in his usual spot. He hesitated, then smiled and asked, “Mind if I join you from the other side?” She said yes. They've been meeting at that table ever since, never switching sides.  
<eos>

<sos>  
Their dogs got tangled on the walking trail. He apologized; she laughed. They untangled the leashes, but kept walking together. “Guess they just knew we’d get along,” she said. He nodded, “Maybe they’re better at dating than we are.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
She left love notes in library books. He found one in a mystery novel. Intrigued, he returned weekly, searching for more. When he finally found her note in a romance section, he added his own: “Dinner?”  
<eos>

<sos>  
He missed his train. She did too. They sat on the bench in silence until he offered a joke. She laughed. One delay turned into coffee, and a missed train turned into something more lasting.  
<eos>

<sos>  
At the museum, he stared at a painting she was sketching. “You’ve drawn it better,” he said. She looked up, surprised. “You see the story too?” They talked until closing time, still unsure who approached who first.  
<eos>

<sos>  
Every morning she walked her golden retriever. Every morning, he jogged past with his beagle. One day, both dogs stopped and refused to move until their humans finally talked.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He left a book on the bus. She picked it up, read it, and found his name and email scribbled inside. She wrote: “Your book was lovely. So are your words.” He replied with a date.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She loved the rain. He hated it. They met under the same awning during a storm. She was laughing; he was scowling. “You need a reason to enjoy it,” she said. He looked at her. “Maybe I just found one.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
Their first conversation was an argument over the best pizza topping. It ended with laughter and a shared slice. Years later, at their wedding, the menu read: “Pepperoni and compromise.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
He sang badly at karaoke. She clapped louder than anyone. “You were brave,” she said. “Sing with me next time?” he asked. They did—terribly—and fell in love off-key.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She accidentally sent a text to the wrong number. He replied, teasing her gently. They kept chatting. After a month, he asked, “Still texting strangers or ready to meet one?”  
<eos>

<sos>  
They both reached for the last chocolate bar. She let him have it. He broke it in half and handed her a piece. “Fair is fair,” he said. They’ve been sharing sweets ever since.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She wrote poems in chalk on the sidewalk. He passed by daily, always stopping to read. One day, she found a chalk drawing beside hers: “You write like you see me.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
He found her umbrella in the coffee shop. Instead of returning it right away, he left a note: “Let’s talk under this sometime.” She showed up, umbrella in hand, and a smile.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She taught beginner dance. He signed up with two left feet. “I just wanted to learn something new,” he said. She replied, “Maybe you’ll learn someone too.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
He played piano in the park. She left coins and compliments in his tip jar. One day, she left her number instead. That night, he played only love songs.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She lost her voice at the worst time—on a blind date. He didn’t mind. They scribbled notes, drew doodles, and laughed silently over dinner. “Best conversation I’ve never had,” he wrote.  
<eos>

<sos>  
They were baristas on opposite shifts. She left smiley faces in the tip jar; he left folded origami hearts on the counter. They met one morning, finally overlapping. The coffee spilled, but something else brewed.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He sat behind her in a night class. She doodled in the margins of her notebook. One night, he slipped her a note: “Do your drawings ever fall in love too?”  
<eos>

<sos>  
She always brought extra change to feed the parking meter for the next person. One day, she found a note on her windshield: “I noticed. Want to split a meter sometime?”  
<eos>

<sos>  
He was a wedding photographer. She was always the bridesmaid. He captured her laughter at every event. Finally, she turned and said, “You take such good pictures, but I’d rather be in one with you.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
They met at a costume party—both dressed as the same obscure book character. “Destiny?” she asked. “Or great taste?” he replied. Either way, they wrote their own story.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He helped her carry groceries up the stairs. She baked cookies to thank him. He returned the Tupperware with flowers inside. “Refills accepted,” he said.  
<eos>

<sos>  
They sat beside each other in the doctor’s office for years, never speaking. One day, he coughed and said, “I think my heart skips because of you.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
She always hummed while she walked. He followed the sound, not meaning to stalk, just curious. When she stopped and turned, he said, “Sorry—I just didn’t want the music to end.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
He drew cartoons in the margins of the daily crossword. She filled in the answers. Eventually, she added her number in 7-across.  
<eos>

<sos>  
They ran the same marathon but didn’t meet until afterward, both reaching for the last banana. “Want to split it?” she asked. He smiled. “And the next race?”  
<eos>

<sos>  
He left post-its in the office fridge: “Smile more. Drink water.” She started replying: “Already did. You too.” Months later, they stuck together for good.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She worked the ticket booth; he caught every matinee. “You must really love movies,” she said. “Only when they start with your smile,” he replied.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He kept bumping into her at the laundromat. Finally, he asked, “How many times does it take before I can call this fate?” She replied, “Just one more spin.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
She planted sunflowers in every crack of the sidewalk. He offered to help water them. A week later, he showed up with seeds. “For the next block we grow together.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
He texted her every morning with a quote. One day, he didn’t. She called. “Just wanted to see if you’d notice,” he teased. “I always do,” she whispered.  
<eos>

<sos>  
They were in line at the bakery. Only one cinnamon roll left. He stepped aside. “Ladies first,” he smiled. She tore it in half. “Only if you share it with me.”  
<eos>
<sos>  
She spilled her coffee on his sketchbook at the crowded café. Flustered, she apologized. He glanced at the ruined page and smiled. “You’ve added texture,” he joked. She offered to buy him a new one. He accepted—only if she’d help fill it over coffee.  
<eos>

<sos>  
They both reached for the same book in the quiet aisle of the library. “You first,” she said. “Only if you promise to tell me what you think of it,” he replied. A week later, they met to discuss it. The book was forgettable. The conversation wasn’t.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He played guitar on the street corner every Friday. She always dropped a coin, then lingered. One evening, he played a new song and sang her name. She stopped, heart racing. “It’s yours,” he said. “So is the spot beside me.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
She wore mismatched socks to the office every Thursday. He noticed but never said a word—until he started doing the same. One day, she smiled and asked, “So, we’re a team now?” He grinned. “We’ve always been.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
Their trains crossed at the same station every morning. She waved once, on a whim. He waved back the next day. Soon, it became their ritual. One morning, his train didn’t come. She turned to find him beside her on the platform, holding coffee and a question.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He dropped his grocery list in the aisle. She picked it up and joked, “Impressive taste in snacks.” He chuckled. “Want to help me find them?” They shopped, they laughed, and at checkout, he asked, “Same time next week?”  
<eos>

<sos>  
She danced under fairy lights at a neighborhood party, shoes in hand. He watched from across the lawn, mesmerized. When she offered her hand, he hesitated. “I don’t dance,” he said. “You do now,” she smiled.  
<eos>
<sos>  
Leo found a treasure map in the lining of his grandfather’s coat. With a compass and a backpack full of snacks, he set off through the forest behind the house. The trail led him to a rusted gate and a garden of stone statues. One of them looked just like him.  
<eos>

<sos>  
Maya boarded the wrong train, ending up in a foggy town not on any map. The locals spoke in riddles and watched her carefully. One whispered, “You're not meant to be here... but maybe you’re who we’ve been waiting for.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
Darren followed the old legend about the lake that sang. At dawn, he heard the melody and dove in. Beneath the surface, a glowing tunnel pulsed with rhythm. When he emerged on the other side, the sky was purple and stars moved like fireflies.  
<eos>

<sos>  
Lena’s hike took a wrong turn, and her compass spun wildly. She stumbled upon a field of glowing mushrooms and a cave humming like a heartbeat. She entered cautiously. The moment she stepped inside, her GPS stopped working—and her footprints began to glow.

<eos>

<sos>

<eos>

<sos>  
He hated his job, but he went every day. At retirement, they gave him a plaque. At home, he wept—not for time lost, but because no one asked what he wanted to do next.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She sent her son away to protect him from war. Years later, he returned with new scars and old memories. They sat on the porch, silent. Nothing needed saying.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He carried a photo of her everywhere. She moved on years ago, but he couldn’t. When he died, the nurse found the photo in his wallet. On the back, it read: “If I ever forget me, promise you won’t.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
She sold her wedding ring to fix the car and make rent. “It’s just a ring,” she said. He cried anyway—not for the ring, but because she never told him she was struggling.  
<eos>

<sos>  
They argued over everything—politics, money, paint colors. But every night, she curled into his arms. When she died, he still argued with her picture. And apologized, too.  
<eos>

<sos>  
After years of silence, she called her father. “You still angry?” he asked. “Just lonely,” she replied. He didn’t say anything—just started making tea. She showed up the next day.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He missed the bus every morning. She started saving him a seat. One day, he didn’t come. A month later, a letter arrived: “Thank you for noticing I existed.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
She worked two jobs to support her son’s dream. When he got his acceptance letter, he almost didn’t tell her—afraid she’d sacrificed too much. She cried when she read it: “You made this possible.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
The house was empty after the kids moved out. They fought over little things. One night, he made her tea like always. “We’re still us,” he said. She smiled, grateful for small truths.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He never got the promotion. But every Friday, he brought home flowers. “For showing up,” he said. His kids learned to love the simple things. They still do.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She didn’t cry when he left. She cried when she found his toothbrush still in the drawer. That night, she brushed her teeth beside it anyway.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He found an old voicemail from his mother. “Call me when you get home.” She’d died five years ago. He saved it. He played it every time he made it home safe.  
<eos>

<sos>  
They sat at opposite ends of the diner every Thursday. Divorced ten years. She always ordered his favorite. He always left her favorite tip: a folded crane.  
<eos>

<sos>  
The dog barked at the door every evening. His owner passed last month. But at six o'clock sharp, he still waited—tail wagging, hope unshaken.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She forgot things often. Names, dates, where she put the keys. But she always remembered the way he looked at her the first time they met. That, she said, never left her.  
<eos>

<sos>  
The city tore down the building where he first kissed her. He took a brick from the rubble. Built a small garden wall. Planted daisies. Called it home.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He was late for her funeral. Missed the service. Showed up at dusk. “You’d laugh at me,” he said, placing sunflowers down. “Still bad with time. Still terrible at letting go.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
They never married. Never needed to. She held his hand through his final breath. “Fifty years,” he whispered. “Still not long enough.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
Her paintings never sold. He bought one every month, under a fake name. She never found out. When he died, the gallery revealed the truth. She cried harder than she ever painted.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He lost the use of his legs in the crash. She read to him nightly. When she walked away one evening, he cried—not from pain, but from love still present.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She worked in a bakery, decorating cakes she couldn’t afford. On her birthday, the staff pooled money for one with her name on it. She hadn’t seen her name in frosting in twenty years.  
<eos>

<sos>  
The war ended. He returned. His brother didn’t. He hugged their mother twice—once for himself, once for the man who never made it back.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He always wore mismatched socks. When he died, they buried him in his favorite pair: one with stars, one with stripes. “He never matched,” his daughter said, “but he always showed up.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
They never had children. But the neighbor’s kids came by every day. “You’re our second grandparents,” one said. The woman smiled. “First in our hearts,” the boy added.  
<eos>
<sos>  
He received the invitation by mistake—his ex’s wedding. He almost threw it away. Instead, he went. She smiled when she saw him. “You’re braver than I thought,” she whispered. He replied, “So are you.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
Every morning, she watched the bus pass by without boarding. She hadn’t ridden it since the accident. One day, she stepped on, hands trembling. The driver didn’t ask for a ticket—just nodded.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He found an old cassette labeled “Dad’s voice.” He hadn’t heard it since he was ten. As it played, his hands shook. “Proud of you,” the voice said. He cried into his palms.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She finally opened her mother’s last letter. It wasn’t poetic, just a grocery list and “Don’t forget your jacket.” She smiled. That was her mother—always loving in the quietest ways.  
<eos>

<sos>  
The storm ruined her wedding day. Dress soaked, cake destroyed. Then he knelt in the mud, held her hand, and whispered, “Let’s build something stronger than sunshine.” She laughed through tears.  
<eos>

<sos>  
His father never said “I love you.” But when he got sick, he left a notebook of advice. On the last page: “If you’re reading this, know I always did.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
She saved every birthday card from her sister, who hadn’t spoken to her in years. The last one read, “Let’s try again.” She picked up the phone before she could change her mind.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He worked three jobs for his daughter’s school fees. On graduation day, he sat in the back row, unnoticed. She scanned the crowd, locked eyes, and mouthed, “Thank you.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
She carried a photo of her husband in her wallet. He’d passed a decade ago. Every time she paid for groceries, she looked at it and smiled. “Still shopping for two,” she’d joke.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He read the last message she sent before blocking him: “I just want you to try.” He did—therapy, forgiveness, patience. Years later, he wished he could tell her.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She returned to the lake they used to visit. Tossed a pebble and whispered, “I forgive you.” The wind carried the words across the water.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He missed her ballet recital to work overtime. Years later, she mailed him a photo—her first stage, her first shoes. “Thanks for paying for them,” the note read.  
<eos>

<sos>  
The doctor said she had six months. She bought a journal, labeled it “Things I Was Too Scared To Do.” She filled every page before the end.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He held the phone for hours after the breakup, fingers hovering. He didn’t call. Instead, he wrote a letter he’d never send, folded it, and buried it under his favorite tree.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She won the award but left it at her mother’s grave. “You taught me how to fight,” she whispered. “And how to win quietly.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
They didn’t speak for five years. Then one night, a song came on they both loved. He texted: “Still remember this?” She replied with a heart.  
<eos>

<sos>  
The teacher told him he’d never amount to anything. He taped that comment to his fridge. Years later, he mailed a copy of his book—signed—to the school.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She found the letter her dad wrote before he left: “Someday you’ll understand.” She didn’t. But she forgave him anyway.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He proposed with a paper ring. “I’m broke, but I’m yours.” She cried. “I’ve waited for everything but this.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
Her son forgot her birthday. No card, no call. But that night, he showed up with takeout and said, “Let’s eat like we used to.” She smiled and forgave him instantly.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He hated his father until he became one. Then he cried during lullabies, understood the silence, the hard hands, the heavy love.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She never learned to swim, too scared of the water. On her 70th birthday, her granddaughter took her hand and said, “Let’s try.” She floated.  
<eos>

<sos>  
After their breakup, he still left the porch light on. She came back once—just to see. He was asleep inside. That was enough.  
<eos>

<sos>  
The letter was unsigned but familiar. “I miss us.” She knew the handwriting, the tilt of the T’s. She smiled, then lit it on fire.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He never said goodbye to his childhood dog. Years later, he walked a similar trail. The memories hit harder than the wind.  
<eos>

<sos>  
They danced in the living room every Saturday. No music, just habit. When she passed, he danced alone, humming their song.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She kept the voicemail where he apologized. “You deserved better.” She replayed it whenever she doubted herself.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He proposed in the hospital. “If we have now, let’s make it forever.” She smiled through the tubes. “Now is enough.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
The boy never cried when his parents divorced. But he started drawing homes. Hundreds of them. Different sizes, different roofs. Each one said “safe.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
She was adopted at six and never knew her real birthday. Her family gave her a new one. “It’s the day you became ours,” they said.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He wrote his eulogy before he died. “Tell them I tried. Tell them I was learning how to love.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
She visited her childhood home before it was demolished. In the backyard, her initials were still carved in the tree. She ran her fingers over them and said goodbye.  
<eos>

<sos>  
They sat in silence after the miscarriage. No words. Just hands clasped, tight enough to say, “We’re still here.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
He passed the exam on his fifth try. His mom baked a cake anyway after each one. “I never doubted you,” she said. “Even when you did.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
She never made it to the Olympics. But years later, she coached a little girl to gold. “You made it,” the girl said. “We both did,” she replied.  
<eos>
<sos>  
He hadn't returned home in ten years. When he did, the house was smaller, quieter. His mother hugged him longer than necessary. “You’re still my boy,” she said, tears in her voice. He nodded. The past didn’t disappear, but for now, forgiveness lived in the hallway.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She read the same book every year on her mother’s birthday. The cover was tattered, the pages worn. It had been their favorite bedtime story. Each word felt like a heartbeat. That night, she fell asleep with it on her chest, dreaming of lullabies.  
<eos>

<sos>  
After losing his job, he didn’t tell anyone. Every morning, he left home dressed as usual, sat in the park, and watched strangers. One day, a child handed him a crayon drawing. “You look sad,” it read. He cried for the first time in months.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She saved every letter her brother wrote from prison. After his release, he brought them back. “I kept copies,” he said, smiling. “They reminded me who I wanted to be.” She held his hand. They began again.  
<eos>

<sos>  
The nurse hummed a familiar tune as she adjusted the old man’s blanket. “My wife used to sing that,” he whispered. She paused. “She was my grandmother,” the nurse replied, smiling softly. He cried without shame.  
<eos>

<sos>  
They fought daily, but every morning, he brewed her coffee just the way she liked it. She hated admitting it, but she waited for that cup. One morning, it wasn’t there. Neither was he.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He never liked birthdays. Too many expectations. But when his daughter sang to him—off-key, full of joy—he smiled and clapped. “This one’s the best,” he said, and meant it.  
<eos>

<sos>  
Her father never read to her. Too busy, too tired. But on her wedding day, he stood up and read her favorite poem from childhood, voice cracking. She ran to him before he finished.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He donated anonymously to a school he never attended. Years later, he walked past the playground and saw his name on a plaque. A child sat beneath it, reading. He smiled and kept walking.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She threw away his sweaters after the breakup. Except one. She didn’t wear it, just kept it at the back of her closet, like a memory folded in wool.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He hated hospitals. When his friend got sick, he visited every day. Held his hand through chemo, brought books, told jokes. “You’re braver than I am,” the friend whispered. “I learned from you,” he replied.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She watched her son leave for college without turning back. She didn’t cry until she found his childhood toy under the bed. She hugged it like it still breathed.  
<eos>

<sos>  
The letter arrived late—his acceptance to a dream university. His mother opened it after his funeral. She framed it next to his graduation photo. “He made it,” she told everyone.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He visited the same bench every Sunday. It was where she’d said yes. Now he sat alone, talking to her as if she were still beside him. The pigeons listened.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She practiced her speech all night. When her turn came, the words left her. She looked at the crowd, trembling. Then her brother stood and clapped. Everyone followed. That was enough.  
<eos>

<sos>  
They divorced amicably, stayed friends for the kids. At their daughter’s wedding, he asked her to dance. “For old times?” She nodded. For a moment, it felt like love again.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He worked the night shift, never complained. When his daughter graduated, he sat in the back in uniform. She waved from the stage. “He gave me everything,” she said into the mic.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She wore her mother’s earrings to the interview. “For luck,” she whispered. When she got the job, she kissed them gently. “We did it,” she said to the empty car seat.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He found the old mixtape they made as teenagers. When he played it, memories flooded in. He called her for the first time in twenty years. They talked until dawn.  
<eos>

<sos>  
After his diagnosis, he started painting. No one knew he could. At the gallery, strangers cried before his work. “I never spoke much,” he said. “This is everything I meant.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
She never told her father she was gay. At her wedding, he gave a toast: “Love is love. My daughter taught me that.” She wept.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He stood outside the classroom, afraid to walk in. The professor opened the door, smiled. “You’re not too old to start,” she said. He stepped in, notebook shaking in hand.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She sold her grandmother’s locket to pay rent. Years later, she found it at a pawn shop. It still had the photo inside—and a note: “I knew you’d come back.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
He was known as the grumpy neighbor. One winter, he shoveled every driveway on the block. “You’re not so grumpy,” a child said. “Just lonely,” he replied.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She carried a typewriter everywhere, never a laptop. “I like hearing the words arrive,” she said. After her passing, her family found hundreds of letters addressed to strangers. All unsent.  
<eos>

<sos>  
He never learned to read. At 72, he enrolled in adult classes. When he read his first sentence aloud, his classmates cheered. He smiled wider than he ever had.  
<eos>

<sos>  
They reunited at a high school reunion. Both single, both quieter than before. “Let’s not lose each other again,” she said. He nodded, hope filling the silence.  
<eos>

<sos>  
Her husband forgot their anniversary. She didn’t say a word. That night, he cooked dinner, set the table, and whispered, “You’re the only date I never want to miss.”  
<eos>

<sos>  
He gave his son a dusty old guitar. “I never learned,” he said. The boy did. Years later, he played it on stage, pointing to his dad in the front row.  
<eos>

<sos>  
She told her daughter every scar had a story. When the girl asked about the one on her heart, she said, “That one’s still healing.”
